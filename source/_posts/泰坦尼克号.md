# 简介
   这是kaggle上101的一个竞赛题目，可以作为机器学习的训练。这是一个二分类问题。
我们通过机器学习的分类算法来预测船上成员的存活情况。
## 背景
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

泰坦尼克号之沉没，造成1504名乘客及船员丧生。造成此悲剧的一个重要原因是救生衣远远不够。虽然有幸运因素，但是一些群体诸如妇女、儿童和上层阶级更容易幸存。在此题中，我们要你分析什么人更容易幸存。

## 数据介绍
变量介绍
- PassengerID 乘客编号
- Survived 是否存活(0 = No; 1 = Yes)
- Pclass 船舱等级(1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
- Name 姓名
- Sex 性别
- Age 年龄
- SibSp 船上兄妹、配偶的数量
- Parch 船上父母和孩子的数量
- Ticket 船票号
- Fare 船票价格
- Cabin 船舱的位置
- Embarked 登船的港口(C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

    注:如果年龄不确定，令其为xx.5，用Sibsp和Parch来表示家庭关系的变量。

## 评价指标
在测试集中，预测得到的Survived情况与真实的Survived的预测的准确率。
$$precision = \frac\{\sum_\{i=1\}^\{N\}\mid \widehat\{y_i\} - y_i \mid\}{N}$$
